Lactate Threshold Analysis Tool - Summary
The application I've designed is a comprehensive Streamlit-based web tool for analyzing lactate threshold tests for cycling, running, and swimming, matching the requirements you specified.
Key Features:

Multi-sport Support:

Cycling (power in watts)
Running (speed in km/h and pace in min/km)
Swimming (speed in m/s and pace in min/100m)


Multiple Threshold Methods:

Fixed values (2.0 mmol/L, 4.0 mmol/L)
OBLA (Onset of Blood Lactate Accumulation)
LT (Lactate Threshold - baseline + 1.0 mmol/L)
IAT (Individual Anaerobic Threshold - baseline + 0.5 mmol/L)
Modified Dmax (maximum perpendicular distance method)
Log-Log method
And more configurable methods


Interactive Interface:

Step-by-step protocol setup
Easy data input with a data editor
Results visualization with interactive charts
Training zone calculations and visualizations


Branded Design:

Custom styling with Montserrat font
Your brand color (#E6754E) throughout the interface
Responsive layout with Streamlit components


Export Capabilities:

Comprehensive PDF report generation
Includes athlete info, results, training zones, and explanations
Branded with your logo and color scheme



How to Use:

Installation: Install the required packages from requirements.txt
Run: Execute the app using streamlit run main.py
Usage Flow:

Setup athlete information and test type
Configure protocol parameters
Input test data (intensity, heart rate, lactate values)
Calculate thresholds
View and export results



Files Included:

main.py: The main application code
requirements.txt: Dependencies for easy installation
logo_setup.py: Helper script to create a placeholder logo
README.md: Documentation for using and customizing the app

The tool follows your specifications for threshold calculations, including the modified DMax method where it draws a line from the first point where lactate exceeds baseline+0.5 mmol to the maximum lactate point, then finds the furthest point from this line.
